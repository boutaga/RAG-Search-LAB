## Structure

- `labs/`: Step-by-step practical labs covering pgvector, CDC-driven embedding updates, scalable vector search, lakehouse integration, and troubleshooting.
- `docs/`: Best practices, troubleshooting tips, and a glossary of key terms.

## Getting Started

1. Explore each lab in the `labs/` directory.
2. Refer to the `docs/` folder for best practices, troubleshooting, and definitions.
3. Follow the instructions in each lab to build your skills in vector search and data engineering.
